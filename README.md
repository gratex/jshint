JSHint, A Static Code Analysis Tool for JavaScript
==================================================

JSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in
JavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions. We made JSHint
very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines
and the environment you expect your code to execute in.

Our goal is to help JavaScript developers write complex programs without
worrying about typos and language gotchas.

We believe that static code analysis programs—as well as other code quality
tools—are important and beneficial to the JavaScript community and, thus,
should not alienate their users.

For general usage information, visit our website: [http://jshint.com/](http://jshint.com/).

Reporting a bug
---------------

To report a bug simply create a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and
describe your problem or suggestion. We welcome all kind of feedback regarding JSHint including but
not limited to:

 * When JSHint doesn't work as expected
 * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers
 * When you simply want a new option or feature

Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets that
cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.

Installation
------------

You can install JSHint via NPM:

	npm install jshint -g

We also provide platform wrappers for Rhino, JavaScriptCore and Windows Script Host. To
use them, clone this repo and run our build command:

	node make.js

Usage
-----

    jshint -h

You can also require JSHint itself as a module.

    var jshint = require('jshint');

Note: If you are using npm v1.x be sure to install jshint locally (without the -g flag) or link it globally.

Custom Reporters
----------------

Specify a custom reporter module (see example/reporter.js).

    --reporter path/to/reporter.js

Use a jslint compatible xml reporter.

    --jslint-reporter

Show additional non-error data generated by jshint (unused globals etc).

    --show-non-errors

Configuration Options
---------------------

**Note:** This behavior described below is very different from versions prior to `0.6`.

The CLI uses the default options that come with JSHint.

Only one extra option is unique to node-jshint: `globals`
allows you to define an object of globals that get ignored for every file.
To see an example you can look at how whitelisted globals are defined
in the [jshint code](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/c047ea1b01097fcc220fcd1a55c41f67ae2e6e81/jshint.js#L556)

To have your own configuration apply, there are several methods you can use:

### Specify Manually

Setting the `--config=/path/to/your/config` command line option to specify your own configuration file outside of the directory tree for your project.

### Within your Project's Directory Tree

When the CLI is called, and a configuration file isn't specified already, `node-jshint` will attempt to locate one for you starting in `pwd`. (or "present working directory") If this does not yield a `.jshintrc` file, it will move one level up (`..`) the directory tree all the way up to the filesystem root. If a file is found, it stops immediately and uses that set of configuration.

This setup allows you to set up **one** configuration file for your entire project. (place it in the root folder) As long as you run `jshint` from anywhere within your project directory tree, the same configuration file will be used.

### Home Directory

If all the methods above do not yield a `.jshintrc` to use, the last place that will be checked is your user's `$HOME` directory.

## File Extensions

Default extension for files is ".js". If you want to use JSHint with other file extensions (.json), you need to pass this extra extension as an option :

    --extra-ext .json

## Ignoring Files and Directories

If there is a .jshintignore file in your project's directory tree, (also provided you run `jshint` from within your project's directory) then any directories or files specified will be skipped over. (behaves just like a `.gitignore` file)

**Note:** Pattern matching uses minimatch, with the nocase [option](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch). When there is no match, it performs a left side match (when no forward slashes present and path is a directory).

FAQ
---

#### How do I turn off "mixed tabs and spaces" warning?

If you're using so-called [smart tabs](http://www.emacswiki.org/SmartTabs) then
we have an option `smarttabs` for you. Otherwise, your solution is to run JSHint with
a custom reporter that discards any warnings you don't like. For example, this [example
reporter](https://gist.github.com/3885619) discards all warnings about mixed tabs and
spaces.
